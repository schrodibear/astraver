\section{Introduction}

Formal methods deal either with small properties of big programs or
big properties of small programs. This paper describes a case study
which definitely belongs to the latter category.
Indeed, it details the formal verification of the following 2-lines C program:
{\small\begin{verbatim}
t(a,b,c){int d=0,e=a&~b&~c,f=1;if(a)for(f=0;d=(e-=d)&-e;f+=t(a-d,(b+d)*2,(
c+d)/2));return f;}main(q){scanf("%d",&q);printf("%d\n",t(~(~0<<q),0,0));}
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent 
This rather obfuscated code was found on a web page gathering C signature
programs\footnote{\url{http://www.iwriteiam.nl/SigProgC.html}} and is
apparently due to Marcel van Kervinc. This is a standalone C program
which reads an integer on the standard input, say $n$, and then prints another
integer on the standard output, say $f(n)$. If $n$ is smaller than the
machine word size (typically 32), then
$f(n)$ appears to be the number of solutions to the famous $n$-queens
problem, that is the number of ways to put $n$ queens on a $n\times n$
chessboard so that they cannot beat each other. And even more
surprisingly, this is a very efficient program to compute this number.

As a case study for \caduceus, a tool we are
co-developing~\cite{caduceus}, we considered 
the formal verification of this program. By verification, we mean here
the mechanically-assisted proof that this program (1) does not crash, 
(2) terminates, and (3) indeed computes the right number. We find this
challenging since these two lines of code are at the same time idiomatic C
programming, complex from an algorithmic point of view and highly
efficient. Thus we can demonstrate the ability of our tools to tackle
a wide range of verification issues without considering a too long
program. 

This paper is organized as follows. First Section~\ref{unobf}
``unobfuscates'' the program, unravelling the mystery of its algorithm
and data. Then Section~\ref{caduceus} briefly introduces \caduceus.
Finally Section~\ref{verif} details the formal verification,
namely the logical annotations inserted in the program
and the methods used to discharge the resulting verification conditions.

\section{Unobfuscation}\label{unobf}

Before entering the formal verification process, we first unravel the
mystery behind this obfuscated code. The code is composed of two
parts: a recursive function \texttt{t}, which takes three integers as
arguments and returns an integer; and a main function which reads an
integer from the standard input, makes a call to the function
\texttt{t} and prints the result on the standard output.
With type declarations and a bit of indentation, the function
\texttt{t} reads as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
int t(int a, int b, int c) {
  int d=0,e=a&~b&~c,f=1;
  if(a) for(f=0;d=(e-=d)&-e;f+=t(a-d,(b+d)*2,(c+d)/2));
  return f;
}
\end{verbatim}
The assignment \verb!d=(e-=d)&-e! actually does not conform with the
ANSI norm, because it assumes that the inner assignment \verb!e-=d! is
performed before the evaluation of \verb!-e!. This is not guaranteed
and the compiler may freely choose between the two possible evaluation
strategies. Since \caduceus\ only deals with ANSI C programs,
we need to modify the code. Fortunately, this is quite easy:
since \verb!d! is initialized to 0 we can move the
assignment \verb!e-=d! to the end of the loop body and save the
initialization. We have even reduced the size of the original code.
The second modification we make is to replace the \texttt{main}
function with a \texttt{queens} function from \texttt{int} to
\texttt{int}, since \caduceus\ does not support the \texttt{scanf} and
\texttt{printf} library functions.
We end up with the code given in Figure~\ref{fig:code}, which is the
one we prove correct in this paper.

int t(int a, int b, int c) {
  int d, e=a&~b&~c, f=1;
  if (a)
    for (f=0; d=e&-e; e-=d)
      f += t(a-d,(b+d)*2,(c+d)/2));
  return f;
}
int queens(int n) {
  return t(~(~0<<n),0,0);
}
\end{verbatim}

We now explain how the program works. This is a backtracking algorithm
which fills the rows of the chessboard one at a time.
%--- there is no better way to solve the $N$-queens problem --- 
More precisely, each call to \texttt{t} enumerates all possible
positions for a queen on the current row with the \texttt{for} loop
and, for each of them, recursively calls \texttt{t} to set the next
rows.  The number of solutions is accumulated in \texttt{f} and
returned.  The key idea is the use of integers as \emph{sets} or
equivalently as \emph{bit vectors}: $i$ belongs to the ``set'' $x$ if and
only if the $i$-th bit of $x$ is set.
Following this idea, the program variables
\texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c}, \texttt{d} and \texttt{e} must
be interpreted as subsets of $\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$.
Then almost all computations in this program are actually to be
understood as set operations. Some of them are obvious: \verb!a&~b&~c!
computes the set $\mathtt{a}\backslash\mathtt{b}\backslash\mathtt{c}$,
the test \verb!if(a)! checks whether \texttt{a} is empty, etc. Other
are more subtle. For instance, \verb!e&-e! computes the smallest
element of \texttt{e} (as a singleton set). This is a 
property of the twos-complement representation, exploited in
Patricia trees~\cite{patricia} implementations in particular.
Another trick is the computation of the set
$\{0,1,\dots,\mathtt{n}-1\}$ as \verb!~(~0<<n)!. Finally,
multiplication by 2 (resp. division by 2) is used to add 1 (resp.
subtract 1) to each element of a set; we write $S$ and $P$ these two
set operations in the following. We can thus write a more
abstract version of the code which only deals with finite sets. It is
displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:abstract}.

\end{obeylines}}

It is now easier to explain the algorithm. The set $a$ contains the
columns not yet assigned to a queen, thus the candidate positions
for the queen to be set on the current row. Initially, $a$ contains
all possible positions, that is  $a = \{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$. 
We have found one solution whenever $a$ becomes empty and then we return 1.
Otherwise, we have to consider all possible positions on the current
row. The sets $b$ and $c$ respectively contain the positions which
must be avoided because they are on an ascending (resp. descending)
diagonal of a queen on a previous row.
Thus $e = a\backslash b\backslash c$ precisely contain the positions to be
considered for the current row. They are all examined one at a time by
repeatedly removing the smallest element from $e$, which is set to $d$.
Then the next rows are considered by a recursive call to $t$ with $a$,
$b$ and $c$ being updated according to the choice of the column $d$
for the current row: $d$ is removed from the set of possible columns
($a\backslash\{d\}$), added to the set of ascending diagonals which is
shifted ($S(b\cup\{d\})$, and similarly  added to the set of
descending diagonals which is shifted the other way ($P(c\cup\{d\})$).
The values of $a$, $b$ and $c$ are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:abc}
for $n=8$ and 3 rows already set.
