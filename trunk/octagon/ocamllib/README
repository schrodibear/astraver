This directory contains the OCaml binding for the Octagon Abstract Domain 
Library.

It also generates a top-level with the library ready to use (try 
`oct-config --mltop` to use it)


* oct_common.ml  module stub implementation (mostly a bunch of "external")
* oct_common.mli module stub interface (mostly the same as oct.ml)
* oct_polka.mli  module stub interface for polyhedra/octagons conversion
* oct_gmp.mli    module stub interface for GMP,MPFR numbers conversion

* oct_ocaml.h   include this to use low-level C/OCaml conversion functions
                for octagons
* oct_ocaml.c   the wrapper



HACK: the Oct module comes from the files oct.ml/oct.mli that are dynamically
generated by cat-ing some of the above files (depending on whether GMP, MPFR
and NewPolka are available...)
