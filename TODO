FEATURES
========

 - arguments which are types

 - option to suppress termination obligations (i.e. partial correctness)
   (=> no validation)

 - mutually recursive functions 
   (many variants over the same type, one relation)

 - keyword absurd (similar to "assert false" in ocaml)

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

 - do not overwrite .bak if no change

 - references mentioned in specs are added to read references; e.g.
       t:array 10 of int -> {} unit { access(t,1) = 2 }
    => t:array 10 of int -> {} unit reads t { access(t,1) = 2 }

 - floats: post-condition annotating an assignement (x := E { x = E })
   uses generic equality (t_eq); should be t_eq_float on floats
