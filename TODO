FEATURES
========

 - Java input
   see http://home.inreach.com/bronikov/grammars/java.html

 - pure code output (with annotations as comments)

 - functional code output (mainly to check the interpretation; auto-check?)

 - arguments which are types

 - option to suppress termination obligations (i.e. partial correctness)

 - mutually recursive functions 
   (many variants over the same type, one relation)

 - option to pass a default tactic (to be inserted into Coq scripts)

COQ

 - validation

 - libraries

DOCUMENTATION
=============

 - bibliography

 - examples

 - Coq library (in ref man)

 - semantics (evaluation strategy)

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

 - references mentioned in specs are addes to read references; e.g.
       t:array 10 of int -> {} unit { access(t,1) = 2 }
    => t:array 10 of int -> {} unit reads t { access(t,1) = 2 }

 - wp(t[e1] := e2) does not propagate wp inside e2
   => transform into "let v2 = e2 in let v1 = e1 in t[v1] := v2"

 - suppress Coerce node?

 - wf recursion only on type int (built-in in Monad.wfrec)

 - type predicates
   => declare predicates in input files with a syntax like
	predicate P(type,...,type)
   only pure types?

 - automatic proofs of trivial obligations such as
  
     x=t, A and P(t) |- P(x)
     A and B |- A
     A, B |- A and B
