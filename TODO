 - pure code output (with annotations as comments)

 - functional code output (mainly to check the interpretation; auto-check?)

 - arguments which are types

 - option to suppress termination obligations (i.e. partial correctness)

 - mutually recursive functions 
   (many variants over the same type, one relation)

DOCUMENTATION
=============

 - bibliography

 - examples

BUGS

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

 - force result name "result" internally (but keep given name for PP)

 - variant = identifier ?

 - well-formedness of types (in external, in particular)
