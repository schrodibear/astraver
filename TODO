 - Java input
   see http://home.inreach.com/bronikov/grammars/java.html

 - pure code output (with annotations as comments)

 - functional code output (mainly to check the interpretation; auto-check?)

 - arguments which are types

 - primitive functions, like =, applied to non-pure terms

 - option to suppress termination obligations

DOCUMENTATION
=============

 - bibliography

 - examples

BUGS
