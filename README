AstraVer is a fork of the Jessie plug-in that allows deductive verification
of C programs annotated with ACSL and is primarily targeted at
Linux kernel modules source code. It uses the language and tools
of the Why3 platform (http://why3.lri.fr/). Unlike original Jessie,
AstraVer is not distributed as a part of the Why2 certification platform
and is compiled/installed separately.
