Jessie2 is a fork of Jessie plug-in that allows deductive verification of
C programs annotated with ACSL and primarily targeted at Linux kernel
modules source code. It uses the language and tools of the Why3
platform (http://why3.lri.fr/). Unlike original Jessie, Jessie2 is not
distributed as a part of the Why2 certification platform and is
compiled/installed separately.
