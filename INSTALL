INSTALLATION
============

  You need OCaml >= 4.02.1 and Frama-C Neon 20140301 to compile the sources.

  1. Configure with "./configure"

  2. Compile with "make".

  2. Install with "make install".  You may need superuser permissions.


If you are willing to use Coq (more precisely if Coq is detected when
running ./configure), you need Coq >= 7.4.


If you are willing to verify floating-point C programs using Coq, you
need to install the Coq library on floating-point arithmetic available at
http://flocq.gforge.inria.fr/
