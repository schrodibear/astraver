INSTALLATION
============

  You need Objective Caml >= 3.08 to compile the sources.
 
  1. Configure with "./configure"

  2. Compile with "make".  

  2. Install with "make install".  You may need superuser permissions.


If you are willing to use Coq (more precisely if Coq is detected when
running ./configure), you need Coq >= 7.4.
