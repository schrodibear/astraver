==============================
  o new option --pvs-preamble
  o change in syntax: "external" is now a modifier for "parameter" and
    "logic" (see the manual for explainations); to be conservative,
    the following substitutions have to be made:
       "external" -> "external parameter"

    (to be released soon with Why)
  o support for polymorphism (contribution by C. Marché)
  o syntax of haRVey output now uses integer constants, predefined
    arithmetic operators, and does not change capitalization of
    variables, to be conform with the syntax of the next version of
    haRVey (presumably 0.4)
    Also added option --no-harvey-prelude

  o syntax: pre- and postconditions brackets now come by pairs (but,
    inside, the predicates may be omitted)

  o no more "pvs" declaration (the user can now edit the _why.pvs file)
  o fixed bug in type-checking of recursive functions with exceptions

  o C input (incomplete: no arrays, no pointers, no recursive functions)
  o Coq: helper tactics (AccessSame, AccessOther, ...)
  o fixed bug in application typing
  o major change:
    arrays do not have a dependent type anymore; array_length introduced
  o Emacs mode for editing Why ML source (in lib/emacs)
  o automatic discharge of ...|-(well_founded (Zwf 0))
    and of ...,v=t,...,I and (Zwf 0 t' t),...|-(Zwf 0 t' v)
