Before presentation on Frama-C Day:
  * [X] Fix location parsing for in-line annotations e.g. a +/*@%*/ b -/*@%*/ c
  * [X] Fix strange bug with preprocessing and locations in the example by Evgeny Kornykhin (GCC BUG 23779!!!)
  * [X] Find a way to restore tabs in the preprocessed outputs
  * [X] Support splitted preprocessor output (one input line on several output lines)
  * [ ] Support casts to logic types in logic e.g. (integer)1
  * [ ] Provide special support for annotating implicit casts (insert cast_mod to itself with attr ASizeOf?)
  * [ ] Provide a separate option for annotation preprocessing to disallow certain macroses in annotations (e.g. va_lists)
  * [ ] Allow arbitrary recursive definitions in Why3
  * [ ] Remove special translation for recursive *logic* functions in Jessie
  * [ ] Add CVC4 configuration with inductive reasoning enabled
  * [ ] Fix gconfig for current tab and tabs in Why3 IDE
  * [ ] Add 'save config' option to File menu in Why3 IDE
  * [ ] Merge Jessie with Alpha2
  * [ ] Merge Why3 with origin/master
  * [ ] enable C11 in Frama-C (to support typedef redefinition by default)
  * [ ] Support conjunctions in introduce_premises
  * [ ] Add explanations for assigns clauses (region names)

Later, but in the next release:
  * [ ] Add ghost function parameters (pointers, in particular) to support returning existential witnesses e.g. in strcmp
  * [ ] Implement special translation for undefined (unspecified) sequence
  * [ ] Fix Coq support!
  * [ ] Add transformation to support simple inductive reasoning
  * [ ] Add preliminary properties (auto-lemmas) implementation with Why3 transformation

Later:
  * [ ] Logic in code & types
  * [ ] Datatypes from ACSL to Why3ML
  * [ ] New memory model
  * [ ] Proper support for reinterpretation
  * [ ] Ownership methodology (but no parallelism, only coarse-grained locking)

Even later:
  * [ ] Inlined axiomatic definitions
  * [ ] Domains & moving
