Before presentation on Frama-C Day:
  * [ ] Fix location parsing for in-line annotations e.g. a +/*@%*/ b -/*@%*/ c
  * [ ] Fix strange bug with preprocessing and locations in the example by Evgeny Kornykhin
  * [ ] Find a way to restore tabs in the preprocessed outputs
  * [ ] Support casts to logic types in logic e.g. (integer)1
  * [ ] Provide special support for annotating implicit casts (insert cast_mod to itself with attr ASizeOf?)
  * [ ] Provide a separate option for annotation preprocessing to disallow certain macroses in annotations (e.g. va_lists)
  * [ ] Allow arbitrary recursive definitions in Why3
  * [ ] Remove special translation for recursive *logic* functions in Jessie
  * [ ] Fix gconfig for current tab and tabs in Why3 IDE
  * [ ] Merge with Alpha2
  * [ ] enable C11 in Frama-C (to support typedef redefinition by default)


Later, but in the next release:
  * [ ] Add ghost function parameters (pointers, in particular) to support returning existential witnesses e.g. in strcmp
  * [ ] Implement special translation for undefined (unspecified) sequence
  * [ ] Fix Coq support!
