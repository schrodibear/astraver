\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented a machine-checked full verification of the Schorr-Waite
algorithm, directly on a real C source version of it. We have not only
proved the behavioral properties of it, like previous
works~\cite{bornat00mpc,mehta03cade}, but we have also proved that no
invalid pointer dereferencing may occur, and the
termination. Moreover we used a tool for arbitrary C programs, without
anything specialized for this case study, which additionally gives the
choice of the back-end prover.

We claim this is a very successful case study, which provides a clear
evidence that the \caduceus{} approach is powerful. Anyway, there are
still many potential improvements. There is a clear need for
cooperation between automatic provers and interactive
ones. Interactive provers are nice because they are very expressive
and allow to prove manually difficult goals, but their automatic
tactics are less powerful than automatic provers. This is especially
true for Coq, because any decision procedure in it needs to provide a
checkable proof trace, making its integration very difficult.

Several improvements to the \caduceus{} tool are in progress. There are
scaling up issues for dealing with code of large size. We are
currently investigating solutions, in particular by integration of
advanced static analysis techniques.

An interesting question is what would be the next ``mountain to
climb'' for pointer program verification? multi-procedure programs,
